I recently came across <a href = "https://globe.chromeexperiments.com/">The WebGL Globe </a> released by the <a href = "https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe"> Google Data Arts Team </a> 
and thought it would be cool to bring into some projects I was working on.
<br><br>
Heavily leveraging the Javascript <a href = "https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> 3D library, it provides 
a nice, interactive rendering of non-negative measures by geographic location.    

This post steps through how to get this up and running including how to host this visual on a simple http web-server on your local machine using Python.
<br><br>

<h3>Step 1:</h3> Have a look at Google's example showing <a href = "http://globe.chromeexperiments.com/"> global population growth </a> in the 20th century. 
To display your data in this way you will need your input data arranged in a clunky json format as follows: <br><br>
[
<p style="text-indent: 40px">[<i> <b>'seriesA'</b>, [ latitude, longitude, magnitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ... ] </i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">]</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">[<i> <b>'seriesB'</b>, [ latitude, longitude, magnitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ... ] </i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">]</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">...</p>

]<br><br>

To transform your data in this way will undoubtedly require some data manipulation as well as a map of latitude/longitude coordinates onto locations (___ provides a handy reference 
table for this). For example your data may more typically look like the below: <br><br>

<table align="center">
<caption><b>Table 1:</b> Sample data</caption>

  <tr>
    <th>Product Name</th>
    <th>Location</th>
    <th>Sales</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product A</td>
    <td>London</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product A</td>
    <td>Sydney</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product A</td>
    <td>Melbourne</td>
    <td>34</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product B</td>
    <td>Boston</td>
    <td>14</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product B</td>
    <td>New York</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br><br>

In this case the <b><i>'seriesA'</i></b>, <b><i>'seriesB'</i></b> labels in the json file would be <b><i>'Product A'</i></b> and <b><i>'Product B'</i></b>. These labels will also need to be reflected in an 
underlying <b>index.html</b> file. This is 
described in some more detail in <b>Step 4</b> below <br><br>

<h3>Step 2:</h3> Download the 'globe' folder from the <a href = "https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe"> Data Arts </a> GitHub page and move <b> index.html </b>
into the folder location one level above the globe folder 
<br><br> 
The two files you will need to edit are:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li> 1. <b> index.html </b> which is what you will need to edit to customise the globe </li>
	<li> 2. <b> population909500.json </b> which is the input data file in json format described above </li>
</ul>

Even if you are not super familiar with html you will see places to customise your globe (e.g. line 4: Title, line 109: Copyrights. etc.) as well as the 
reference to the json input file (line 168.)<br><br>

By default <b> index.html </b> refers to the file location ~/globe/ so move <b> index.html </b> into the folder location one level above the globe folder 
<br><br>

<h3>Step 3:</h3> Get this 'out of the box' version running on your machine. If you simply double-click on the <b> index.html </b> file you will get a static web-page with no globe. 
To get the globe to resolve you can host a local web server on your machine using Python which will display the contents of the <b>index.html</b> file (i.e. the Globe) to you. 
Once you get this baseline version up and running the editing of <b>index.html</b> and the creation of your bespoke json input file are largely 
straight-forward to do.
<br><br> 
The below few lines of Python code sets up a local web-server on your machine:

<pre>
	<code class="python">
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	# Filename: PythonHTTPServer.py
	# Title: Sets up a local web server
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	import http.server
	import socketserver

	PORT = 8000

	Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

	httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

	print ("Serving at port", PORT)
	httpd.serve_forever()
	
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	# Shuts down and closes when finished
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	# httpd.shutdown
	# httpd.server_close()
	</code>
</pre>

Ensure you save this .py file in the folder location <u>one level above</u> the globe folder, i.e. with <b>index.html</b>, <b>SimpleHTTPRequestHandler</b> is an HTTP request handler that serves files from the 
current directory and any of its subdirectories. Your folder should now look like the below:<br>

<img src = '/images/GlobeFolder.png'>

After running this Python code, open Chrome and navigate to <a href = "http://localhost:8000"> http://localhost:8000 </a> You should see the full interactive globe now!<br><br>

<img style = "width:100%; height: auto" src = '/images/Globe.png'>

<br><br>
By default the <b>SimpleHTTPRequestHandler</b> will be looking for a file called <b>index.html</b> in the current directory. As you're developing your version of the Globe you 
can of course rename this file to something more meaningful to you, say to <b>MyFirstGlobe.html</b>, located in the same directory, and then navigate to 
<b>http://localhost:8000/MyFirstGlobe.html</b>
<br><br>

<h3>Step 4:</h3>
Customise your version. To do this you will need to alter the <b>index.html</b> file to produce your customised <b>MyFirstGlobe.html</b> file and create a json input data file in
the globe folder, say 
<b>MyFirstGlobeJason.json</b>, that represents the data that you wish to display. There is also some small naming alignment to do to ensure you're referencing the correct json file
from your html file. For example if your data looked like 
<b>Table 1</b> above then <b>MyFirstGlobeJason.json</b> will look like the following:
<br><br>

[
<p style="text-indent: 40px">[<i> <b>'Product A'</b>, [ lat1, long1, 50, lat2, long2, 94, lat3, long3, 34 ] </i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">]</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">[<i> <b>'Product B'</b>, [ lat4, long4, 14, lat5, long5, 7 ] </i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">]</p>

]<br>
where the latitude/longitude pairs are representative coordinates for the cities  

<br><br>

<b>MyFirstGlobe.html</b> file will have the below amendments
<br><br>



<h3>Step 5:</h3>
Roll out more broadly. Once you're happy with your version and want to share within your organisation you have 2 options:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li> 1. Send a couple of interested stakeholders a link to your locally hosted version (i.e. <b>http://localhost:8000/MyFirstGlobe.html</b>) to generate some interest 
	(this will likely result in performance issues if too many people query your machine) </li>
	<li> 2. Ask your IT department to host this on an internal, production web-server for you </li>
</ul>
