If you work in an office, chances are you receive and send a lot of emails.<br><br> -->
<h3> Introduction </h3> <br>
On a recent project I needed to extract some data from a collection of emails in my corporate email account. <br><br> My work email was traditionally not a data set that I was used to querying 
and my first challenge was to get hold of this data (or at least metadata) in a way that allowed me to do some interesting things with it.
<br><br> 
Throughout this process I became curious as to what my Received and Sent emails could tell me about my office environment, main collaborators and my own working style 
and this post describes this. <br>

<!--
Like most professionals in financial services I subscribe to a range of market news and commentary emails. These are written by journalists, investment professionals and market commentators 
and provide daily perspectives on economics, geopolitics, social and behavioural sciences, etc. and the effect these are having, or being hypothesised to have, on market dynamics.

<br><br>

I recently realised there was a potentially very interesting and useful time series of data on current market topics and sentiment being built in my inbox from these emails.
My corporate email was traditionally not a data set that I was used to querying and my first challenge was to get hold of this data (or at least metadata) in a way that 
allowed me to do some interesting things with it.

<h3> Implementing in Python </h3> <br>
The first thing to do was to navigate to my email folder structure and pull something out. Luckily, as is usually the case, a Python module existed that could help, namely pywin32 in this case. The below Python 
code steps through the process for accessing, navigating and extracting some information from my inbox:

<pre> 
	<code class="python">
	###########################################################
	# Title: Querying emails
	# Purpose: Extract metadata from outlook emails with Python
	# Author: Thomas Handscomb
	###########################################################

	# import modules into session
	import pandas as pd
	import win32com.client
	from tqdm import tqdm # Useful module for displaying a progress bar during long loops

	# Define Outlook location
	outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.application")
	mapi = outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

	# Find the folder number of the 'Thomas.Handscomb@[CompanyName].com' meta 
	# data folder to start with
	for k in range(1, len(mapi.Folders)+1):
		try:
			fol = mapi.Folders.Item(k)
			if fol.name == 'Thomas.Handscomb@[CompanyName].com':
				folnum = k
				#print(folnum)
				break            
				
		except Exception as e:
			print('Error:' + '(' + str(k) + ')')
			pass

	print(folnum)
	1
	</code>
</pre>
  
Once you have determined the above folder number, find the 'Inbox' and 'Sent Items' folders within this

<pre> 
	<code class="python">
	Inboxnum, Sentnum = -1, -1

	for l in range(1,30):
		try:
			subfol = mapi.Folders.Item(folnum).Folders.Item(l)
			
			if Inboxnum > 0 and Sentnum > 0:
				break			
			elif subfol.name =='Inbox':            
				Inboxnum = l					
			elif subfol.name =='Sent Items':            
				Sentnum = l
				
		except Exception as e:
			print('Error at loop: %.f' %l)
			pass

	print("%0.f, %0.f" %(Inboxnum, Sentnum))			
	2, 4
	</code>
</pre>

Once the folder numbers are defined, use these to specify the 'Inbox' and 'Sent' folders

<pre> 
	<code class="python">
	
	Inbox = mapi.Folders.Item(folnum).Folders.Item(Inboxnum)
	Sent = mapi.Folders.Item(folnum).Folders.Item(Sentnum)

	# Double check the name
	if Inbox.name == 'Inbox' and Sent.name == 'Sent Items':
		print('Inbox and Sent folders assigned correctly')
		pass
	else:
		print('An error has occured')
	
	'Inbox and Sent folders assigned correctly'
	</code>
</pre>

Now that the Inbox and Sent Items folders have been correctly identified the below loop constructs a dataframe by looping through all items
(i.e. emails) in the Inbox and extracting some metadata from them, namely the date received, the sender and the subject.

<pre> 
	<code class="python">
	# Now that the Inbox and Sent Items folders have been determined,
	# create a blank data frame to store email metadata, in this case (date/time sent, 
	# sender name, email subject)
	Inbox_col_names =  ['Full Date', 'Date', 'Hour', 'Sender', 'Subject']
	Inbox_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = Inbox_col_names)

	# Loop through all Inbox.Items (i.e. emails)
	# the tqdm wrapper puts a progress bar on the loop
	for message in tqdm(Inbox.Items):
		try:
			Inbox_df.loc[len(Inbox_df)] = \\
			[message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
			, message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
			, message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%H")
			, message.Sender
			, message.Subject]
		except:
			pass

	# Confirm you are picking up all emails
	Inbox_df.groupby(['Date']).size()

	# Output data frame to review
	Output_filepath = 'C:/Users'

	Inbox_df.to_csv(Output_filepath+'/Inbox.csv'
				   , encoding = 'utf-8'
				   #, mode = 'a'
				   , index = False
				   , header = True)
	</code>
</pre>

and similarly for my Sent Items

<pre> 
	<code class="python">
	Outbox_col_names =  ['Full Date', 'Date', 'Hour', 'Recipient', 'Subject']
	Outbox_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = Outbox_col_names)

	for message in tqdm(Sent.Items):
		try:
			Outbox_df.loc[len(Outbox_df)] = \\
			[message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
			, message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
			, message.LastModificationTime.strftime("%H")
			, message.To
			, message.Subject]
		except:
			pass
			
		Outbox_df.to_csv(Output_filepath+'/Outbox.csv'
				   , encoding = 'utf-8'
				   #, mode = 'a'
				   , index = False
				   , header = True)
	</code>
</pre>

<h3> Organisational Working Patterns </h3> <br>
The final steps above output two csv files, <b>Inbox_df</b> and <b>Outbox_df</b>, summarising the email datestamp, sender/receiver and subject. 
<br><br>

Starting with my inbox the below shows the aggregated distribution of the hours of the day when colleagues send me emails

<img style = "width:60%; height: auto" src = '/images/Inbox_Distribution.PNG'>

This picture is broadly unsurprising: people tend to come into the office for 9:00am with a bang, take an hour to settle in before blasting a range out at 10:00am. Energised 
after lunch at mid day, colleagues begin another round of fire at 2:00pm before a slow tail off to the end of the day. 
<br><br>
A few dedicated individuals continue late into the evening and some from overseas offices continue overnight.

Sorting by sender illustrated clearly to me who my closest collaborators were (as well as those who spam me the most!) Each row in the below is a unique sender.

<h3> Learnings </h3> <br>
What was more interesting to me was how I was responding to emails. Below is the distribution of my sent emails by sent hour of the day:

<img style = "width:60%; height: auto" src = '/images/Outbox_Distribution.PNG'><br>

I generally followed the same pattern as the broader firm, perhaps a less pronounced spike at 10:00am, and a more pronouced one at 8:00pm when I often logged on again from home. 
The real insight for me was just how many emails I was sending in the morning, typically my most creative and productive time of the day for doing data science. 
<blockquote> Why was I sending so many emails during my most creative time? </blockquote>
Doing so was taking up valuable time to write and distrupting my ongoing concentration on doing or guiding on some difficult piece of data science. 
Worse still, almost none of these emails needed a response in this time. Having reflected on this I began blocking 'non emailing sending' time in my diary in the mornings 
to ensure I was most efficient in executing on a difficult piece of work.<br><br>

<!-- <h3> Future Work </h3> <br>
Large organisations struggle with many aspects of workforce efficiency, effective communication and siloed teams. I think a review of the corporate email server along these lines
would be very illustrative. When trying to promote knowledge sharing and alignment, you could define a 'collaboration' metric as the ratio of sent emails to received.
