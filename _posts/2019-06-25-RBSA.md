<h3>Introduction</h3> <br>
Returns Based Style Analysis (RBSA) is a well known technique in portfolio optimisation that seeks to decompose an investment strategy (for example a 
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund">mutual fund </a>) into 
underlying 'styles' such as Large Cap Growth, Small Cap Value etc. <br> <br>
Developed by Sharpe \([1]\), \([2]\), this technique represents the return series of an investment strategy over \(T\) periods,
\(\{R_t, \, t = 1, \ldots, T\}\), as a linear combination of \(n\) style factors \(F_i\), for example, passive market indices, with individual weightings, \(w_i\):

\begin{align} R_t &= w_{1} F_{1t} + w_{2} F_{2t} + \cdots + w_{n} F_{nt} + \varepsilon_t, \qquad \qquad t = 1, \ldots, T \label{eq:1} \tag{I1} \\ \\
 &= \mathbf{F_t} \cdot \mathbf{w} + \varepsilon_t  \label{eq:2} \tag{I2}
\end{align} 
 
where \(F_{it}\) is the return on the \(i^{th} \) style factor at time \(t\) in \(\eqref{eq:1}\) <br> <br>
and \(\mathbf{F_t}\), \(\mathbf{w}\) written in matrix notation in \(\eqref{eq:2}\) are below,
\begin{equation} 
	\mathbf{F_t} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		F_{1t}, \, F_{2t}, \, \cdots, \, F_{nt}
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\qquad
	\qquad
	\mathbf{w}=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		w_{1}, \, w_{2}, \, \cdots, \, w_{n}
	\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{equation}

<!-- To reference the equation with the \tag above
\(\eqref{eq:1}\)-->
(The RBSA model is therefore a special case of the more general linear factor model, \(R_t= \mathbf{F_t} \cdot \mathbf{w_t} + \varepsilon_t \),
 where the factor weights, \(w_{it}\), are time-invariant)

<br><br>

A benefit of this approach is that unlike fundamental analysis, which relies on the (often not readily available) actual holdings of the strategy to determine the style/asset class weighting, RBSA only 
requires the return series of the investment strategy and market indices which is relatively easily available for publically traded investments via common data vendors like Bloomberg and Morningstar. 

<br><br>

Sharpe proposes choosing the weights \(w_i \) that minimises the <i>variance</i> of the non-factor returns \(\varepsilon_i\). In other words not seeking to minimise the 
<u>distance</u> between
the strategy return stream \(R_{t}\) and the regression model \(\eqref{eq:1}\) but rather to minimise the <u>variance of the distance</u> so that the two time series look as close as possible
to two equidistant lines. See picture below:

<br><br>
The (as close as possible) constant difference between the two return streams is interpreted by Sharpe as representing the manager's constant skill/contribution to the portfolio. This contribution can of 
course be negative.

<br><br>
The problem statement is therefore: <b> Minimise the variance of \(\varepsilon_t \) by only varying the factor weights \(w_i \) </b> <br><br>

Mathematically:
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n} \mbox{var}(\varepsilon_t) &= \mbox{var} (R_t - \mathbf{F_t} \cdot \mathbf{w}) \label{eq:3.0} \tag{I3}\\ \\
\mbox{subject to:} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_1 &= 1 \label{eq:3} \tag{I4} \\
0 \le w_i &\le 1, \quad \forall i \label{eq:4} \tag{I5}
\end{align}

Where the constraint \(\eqref{eq:4}\) describes the requirement of constructing a long only portfolio \(\mathbf{F_t}\) (i.e. weights cannot be negative) and 
without leverage (i.e. weights cannot be greater than \(1\)) <br> <br>

Expanding \(\eqref{eq:3.0}\):



So how do we go about using R to solve this optimisation problem? What if we try to reorganise equation [2]

So the problem can be written as [C]

by assigning the following:

There is a large theory on quadratic programming beyond the scope of this post, however the problem is represented as 

Equation [C] is none other than the standard form of a <b> quadratic programming (QP) problem </b>. As luck would have it R has a QP solver in the 'quadprog' package
  
The example below 

It's a nice introduction to Non-Linear Programming (the other NLP!) as it's the simplest form of quadratic optimisation <br><br>

<h3>Implementing in R:</h3> <br>
This post steps through a simple derivation of the quadratic function and then illustrates how to use the quadratic programming ('quadprog') package in R to do a RBSA. This toy
example uses a return stream over 10 time periods with a choice of 4 underlying indicies

	<pre>
	<code class="r">
	#----------------
	### A Toy Example_TH
	#----------------

	install.packages("quadprog")

	library (quadprog)
	library (Matrix)

	# Fund returns matrix over T = 4 time periods
	T = 4

	e = matrix(1,T,1)
	e
	</code>
	</pre>

Define a very simple return stream here

	<pre> 
	<code class="r">
	# Specify the fund returns
	R <- matrix(c(1.5, 1.6, 1.75, 1.70))
	R

	# n = 4 Index returns over T = 4 time periods
	F1 <- c(0.76, 0.81, 0.89, 0.80)
	F2 <- c(0.93, 0.45, 0.76, 0.45)
	F3 <- c(0.15, 0.17, 0.21, 0.78)
	F4 <- c(0.20, 0.25, 0.58, 0.81)

	n = 4

	F <- cbind(F1, F2, F3, F4)
	F
	t(F)
	</code>
	</pre>

The matrix algebra occurs here

	<pre> 
	<code class="r">
	# Set up the symmetric, positive definite matrix D
	M <- diag(T) - ((e %*% t(e))/T)
	#M <- diag(T)
	class(M)
	M
	</code>
	</pre>
