Returns Based Style Analysis (RBSA) is a well known technique in portfolio analysis that decomposes the factor weightings of 
purely from it's return stream. The benefit of this approach is that unlike style factors, return streams are relatively easily available via common data vendors like 
Bloomberg and Morningstar and are sometimes publically available <br><br>
The broad concept is to ...

It's a nice introduction to Non-Linear Programming (the other NLP!) as it's the simplest form of quadratic optimisation <br><br>
This post steps through a simple derivation of the quadratic function and then illustrates how to use the quadratic programming ('quadprog') package in R to do a RBSA. This toy
example uses a return stream over 10 time periods with a choice of 4 underlying indicies 

	<pre>
		<code class="r">
		#----------------
		### A Toy Example
		#----------------

		install.packages("quadprog")

		library (quadprog)
		library (Matrix)

		# Fund returns matrix over T = 4 time periods
		T = 4

		e = matrix(1,T,1)
		e
		</code>
	</pre>

Define a very simple return stream here

		<pre> 
			<code class="r">
		# Specify the fund returns
		R <- matrix(c(1.5, 1.6, 1.75, 1.70))
		R

		# n = 4 Index returns over T = 4 time periods
		F1 <- c(0.76, 0.81, 0.89, 0.80)
		F2 <- c(0.93, 0.45, 0.76, 0.45)
		F3 <- c(0.15, 0.17, 0.21, 0.78)
		F4 <- c(0.20, 0.25, 0.58, 0.81)

		n = 4

		F <- cbind(F1, F2, F3, F4)
		F
		t(F)
			</code>
		</pre>

The matrix algebra occurs here

		<pre> 
			<code class="r">
		# Set up the symmetric, positive definite matrix D
		M <- diag(T) - ((e %*% t(e))/T)
		#M <- diag(T)
		class(M)
		M
			</code>
		</pre>
