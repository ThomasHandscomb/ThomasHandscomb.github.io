<h3>Introduction</h3> <br>
There is a common misconception that writing code for data science involves sitting in a dark room and effortlessly typing Matrix-esque syntax onto a vast 
array of monitor screens.
In reality coding is generally a slow, non-linear, often frustrating and iterative process involving back tracking, second guessing, Google searching, posting questions on 
<a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/"> Stack Overflow </a> and (most commonly in my experience) copy/pasting and modifying old code that you or someone else has 
previously written. <br><br>
This post is a running log of Python syntax that I constantly find myself referring back to and that has proven to be a useful reference for my team and other colleagues.
