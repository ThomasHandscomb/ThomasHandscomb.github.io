			<span class="byline"> When leading a commercial data science project I invariably:<br> (a) Learn new things <br> (b) Find gaps in my understanding on things that I thought I knew well<br><br>
			A good forcing mechanism for me to ensure I have understood a concept is to simply try to write something down that makes sense at the end of a project. I've captured here a selection of notes from some of my 
			experiences - I hope some are as useful to you as they were to me writing them! </span>
