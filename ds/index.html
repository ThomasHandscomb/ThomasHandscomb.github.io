	<h1> Ideas and Code </h1>
	
	<p> I wanted to collect and share some learnings I've had during the course of my commercial data science career. 
	As my professional work is proprietary the examples here are fully annonimised but are designed to illustrate a concept or outline how you might
	structure some code for your own project <br>
	
		I'm broadly agnostic to the R verses Python debate in data science and the collection of examples here reflect that. Please do get in 
		<a href = "/About"> touch</a> with any questions or comments </p>
